## Project Overview üìã

This project includes 10 JavaScript functions, each designed to solve a specific problem. The solutions are intended to be:
- **Easy to understand** and **self-contained** for quick reference
- **Modularized** with each function in its own file for simplicity
- **Flexible and reusable**, with real-world use cases provided for each function

## Challenges and Solutions üöÄ

Below is a summary of each challenge and the corresponding solution file:

| #  | Challenge                                 | Description                                               | File    |
|----|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| 1  | Reverse an Array                          | Returns an array in reverse order                         | `Q1.js` |
| 2  | Flatten an Array                          | Flattens a nested array to a single level                 | `Q2.js` |
| 3  | Check for Duplicates                      | Checks if an array contains duplicate values              | `Q3.js` |
| 4  | Merge Two Objects                         | Merges two objects into one                               | `Q4.js` |
| 5  | Find the Maximum Number in an Array       | Finds the maximum number in an array                      | `Q5.js` |
| 6  | Group Array of Objects by Property        | Groups objects by a specified property                    | `Q6.js` |
| 7  | Find the Intersection of Two Arrays       | Finds common elements in two arrays                       | `Q7.js` |
| 8  | Calculate the Sum of Array Elements       | Sums all elements in an array                             | `Q8.js` |
| 9  | Remove Falsy Values from an Array         | Filters out falsy values from an array                    | `Q9.js` |
| 10 | Calculate Average of an Array             | Computes the average of all numbers in an array           | `Q10.js` |

## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è

Each function is encapsulated in its respective JavaScript file (`Q1.js`, `Q2.js`, etc.) and can be executed independently. Simply import the required file and call the function with the appropriate parameters.

## Requirements üìå

- A Simple Js Compiler is enough.

### Example

To reverse an array using `Q1.js`:

```javascript
// Import the function from Q1.js
const reverseArray = require('./Q1');

// Test the function
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(reverseArray(array)); // Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
